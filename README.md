# powershellscripts
Hot and fresh scripts! Free for all to use! These are scripts I've been playing around with my VMWare home lab, and they seem to work there! How about for you? 

OK, so I'm not really a developer, but I am a sysadmin interested in learning more, so while I've been labbing at home, I've been trying to make various scripts work in my VM environment (I'm trying to master and learn to be efficient in all the admin aspects of Active Directory). If they work, then fantastic!

The ones that I've put in this repository are the ones that I've gotten to work -- feel free to use them in your environment! You'll have to tweak them for your purposes, as there's no identifying info in there, but it'll work if you plug in the right stuff!
