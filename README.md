# powershellscripts
Hot and fresh scripts! Free for all to use! These are scripts I've been playing around with my VMWare home lab, and they seem to work there! How about for you? 

OK, so I'm not really a developer, but I am a sysadmin interested in learning more, so while I've been labbing at home, I've been trying to make various scripts work in my VM environment (I'm trying to master and learn to be efficient in all the admin aspects of Active Directory). If they work, then fantastic!

I may also just put other random PowerShell scripts in here that I've gotten to work on my personal PC as well. We will see! 

The ones that I've put in this repository are the ones that I've gotten to work -- feel free to use them however you like - just give credit! You'll have to tweak them for your purposes, as they're just templates, but they will work if you plug in the right info in the blanks!
